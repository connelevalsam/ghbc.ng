                <p>Shepherd is someone who takes care of a flock of sheep; it is often used in the Bible to describe anyone who cares for a group of people.
                <p>Jesus Christ is our good shepherd because He takes care of us, He lays down his life on the cross to redeem us from sin.
                <p>Remember the shepherdâ€™s responsibility is the safety and welfare of the flock.
                <p>That is what Jesus does for us; He watches over us and provides for us.
                <p>Sheep cannot live without a shepherd, so also is you and I we need Jesus Christ to live and have eternal life.
