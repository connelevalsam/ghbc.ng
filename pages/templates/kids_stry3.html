                    Abraham obeyed God and left his relatives and country because God told him to go to a new land far away. God promised to give him many children and make him father of nations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    God also changed his name from Abram to Abraham and blessed him and his wife Sarah with a son named Isaac at old age.
                    It pays so much to obey God. Abraham trusted God so much and followed Him where He led.
