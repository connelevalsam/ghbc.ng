            <b>Introduction:</b> 
            The Bible begins the story of Exodus with the genealogy of Jacob and his children, 
            and gives correct account of the numbers of Jacob family members that were in Egypt 
            at the beginning. God is interested in every detail of our lives and family that even 
            the “hairs of our head are numbered”. This shows that there is nothing in us or around 
            us that can escape His eyes of protection, ‘He that watches over us never sleeps nor slumbers’.

                            “The children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, 
                            multiplied and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them”.

                                Is this covenant of blessing and increase only for the Jewish people 
                                or does it extend to us the Gentiles? Gal. 3:13,14.

                        <h3>Testimony of the new king of Egypt</h3>
                        <p>
                            “And he said to his people, look the people of the children of Israel are more 
                            and mightier than we” vs 9. Here, the king of Egypt admitted the dominant power 
                            and greatness of God’s people. We must know that God has given dominion on earth 
                            to His covenant people. Dan. 7:27.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            God’s original intention when He created the earth and every creature was to give 
                            dominion over the earth to man as long as He lived in obedience to Him. Gen.1:26-30. 
                            According to Gen.1:26, the reason God created man was to make him have dominion over 
                            all other creatures. He made man in His image and likeness so that man can rule as 
                            king on earth under God. Psalm 8:3-8.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though man lost the kingship of the world to the devil due to sin of disobedience, 
                            our Lord Jesus who came in the likeness of the sinful man took away sin on the cross 
                            and restore dominion and kingship over the earth to man Cf Col. 2:14,15, Luke. 10:19, 
                            Rev.5:9-10. “But as many as received Him, to them He gave power (right) to become 
                            children of God, to those who believe in His name,” John 1:12.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Envy breeds hatred vs 10-14</h3>
                        <p>
                            The prosperity of the Jews in Egypt stirred up envy and hatred that led to a severe 
                            persecution of the children of Israel by the king of Egypt and his people. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Gen.26:13,14, “the man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became 
                            very prosperous, for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great 
                            number of servants. So the Philistines envied him”. Here, the Bible said as a result 
                            of this envy by reason of his prosperity and greatness, they started persecuting him 
                            and eventually asked him to leave their city. God’s blessings on His children always 
                            provoke hatred and persecution from the devil and his children. 
                            Cf. Matt.5:11-12;  24:9, 10:22; John 15:18-20.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Exod.1:12- “the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew and they 
                            were in dread of the children of Israel”. Afflictions or Persecution cannot stop 
                            God’s plans for His people. Covenant people grow stronger and mightier in times of 
                            trouble and persecution. Persecution becomes the fire of purification, so that 
                            like gold we shine better.
