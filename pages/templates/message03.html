                <b>Introduction:</b> 
                It is interesting to know that whenever God draws programs of redemption and His eternal 
                plan for man, He seeks for a godly woman to execute such plan. I believe that one of the 
                reasons God partners a woman in His eternal program for humanity is because God created 
                a woman to be a helper to man. In other word, it is a woman that helps a man to succeed 
                or fail. Take for instance, after the fall of man in Genesis Chapter three, hear what 
                God had to say to the devil in V 15 “And I will put enmity between you and the woman, 
                and between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise 
                His heel”. Every man has a woman that influences him positively or negatively – 
                “But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the 
                Lord because Jezabel his wife stirred him up”. 1Kings 21:25.

                        <span class="">
                            “So the woman conceived and bore a son. And when she saw that he was a beautiful 
                            child, she hid him three months” v 2. There is no doubt that many times a woman 
                            is more sensitive in the spirit than man. May be because of her emotional attitude 
                            and tender heartedness; her spiritual antenna receives things in the spirit faster 
                            than that of man. Before now, Jochebed (mother of Moses) had had two children 
                            (Miriam and Aaron) before the king decreed that all male Jewish children born 
                            should be thrown into the river. Unfortunately, she had Moses after the decree 
                            was made. This is what the bible said about her, “When she saw that he was a 
                            beautiful child she hid him three months”. Here is what God said to Abraham 
                            about the children of Israel being in bondage in Egypt for four hundred years; 
                            Then He said to Abram; “Know certainly that your descendants will be strangers 
                            in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them, and they will afflict them 
                            four hundred years. And also the nation whom they serve I will judge; afterward 
                            they shall come out with great possessions”. Gen 15:13-14.

                            The time for fulfillment of the above prophecy was drawing near; the prophet must 
                            be raised for it. God in that generation found Jocheched qualified to partner with 
                            Him. Let us look at some qualities that are always seen in these women.

                                    Jochebed saw a unique child that Moses was. She perceived God’s prophetic 
                                    Spirit in him, even though he was still a baby. Rebecca understood God’s 
                                    program by revelation that Jacob and not Esau would continue God’s 
                                    prophetic Agenda for Abraham and his generation even though Esau was her 
                                    first born (Gen. 25:22-23). Mary understood that the prophecy of Isaiah 
                                    that a virgin will conceive shall surely come to pass, so that when 
                                    Angel Gabriel brought the message of the messiah to be born by her, 
                                    she received it. (Lk 1:26-38).

                                    “She hid him three months”. They know that the fall of humanity came 
                                    because Eve who was supposed to help the program God gave to Adam to 
                                    succeed revealed the secret to the Serpent (the devil) Gen 3:1-3. 
                                    Jochebed hid Moses for three months from being destroyed by Pharaoh 
                                    and his agents. Mary had a place in her heart to keep everything 
                                    that happened during the time of birth and childhood of Jesus Christ, 
                                    Lk 2:19,51. The bible says “Esther had not revealed her people or 
                                    family, for Modeccai had charged her not to reveal it”. Esth 2:10,20

                                    “But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of bulrushes 
                                    for him, daubed it with asphalt and pitch, put the child in it, and 
                                    laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank” v 3. The godly woman who 
                                    can partner with God to fulfill Divine prophecy is filled with the 
                                    Spirit of Wisdom. The bible said when Jochebed could no longer hide 
                                    Moses; she refused to give up, be confused or be discouraged. She knew 
                                    God will always make a way for His people. She believed that when one 
                                    door closes another one will open. She drew from the wisdom of the Holy 
                                    Spirit inside her, understanding to make an ark of bulrushes for him, 
                                    and laid it by the river bank. At that time, God directed Pharaoh’s 
                                    daughter to go to bathe at the river. That was where the miracle started. 
                                    Jochebed did not keep Moses and go to the house and sleep. She understood 
                                    that for Moses to be a great deliverer and prophet God intended him to be, 
                                    he must be given a good foundation. Here again, Jochebed knew the importance 
                                    of foundation in human life – Ps 11;3. She kept her daughter Miriam to 
                                    watch and inform her on what happen was going to the child. The whole 
                                    thing worked out the way God wanted and Jochebed became Moses nurse.
